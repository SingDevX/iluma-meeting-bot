## üìã Overview

A Discord bot that automates meeting management for distributed teams across time zones. It sends multi-stage meeting reminders (preview, day-before, morning-of, and during-meeting notifications) and fetches AI-generated meeting summaries from Google Drive's Gemini Notes.

Built specifically for teams working across **Philippine Time (PHT)** and **Mountain Time (MT)** zones, with scheduled meetings on:
- **Tuesday (PHT)**: 3:30 AM - 4:30 AM (Monday 1:30 PM - 2:30 PM MT)
- **Friday (PHT)**: 2:00 AM - 3:00 AM (Thursday 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM MT)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Meeting Schedule

Edit the meeting times in `check_and_announce_meetings()` function:

```python
# Tuesday PHT (3:30 AM - 4:30 AM)
if day == 1:
    tuesday_time = check_date.replace(hour=3, minute=30, second=0, microsecond=0)
    
# Friday PHT (2:00 AM - 3:00 AM)
elif day == 4:
    friday_time = check_date.replace(hour=2, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)
```

### Google Meet Links

Update meeting links in `send_meeting_announcement()`:

```python
# Tuesday meeting
await channel.send("Join here: https://meet.google.com/wsh-ukvd-fqq")

# Friday meeting
await channel.send("Join here: https://meet.google.com/ide-jofk-rjj")
```

### Summary Search Parameters

Modify the Gemini document search criteria:

```python
def get_latest_gemini_summary(hours_back=24):  # Adjust hours_back
    query = f"name contains 'Notes by Gemini' and modifiedTime > '{one_hour_ago}'"
```

---

## üí° Usage

### Running Locally

```bash
python bot.py
```

The bot will:
1. Start the HTTP server on port 10000 (for Render)
2. Connect to Discord
3. Announce "Bot is online!" in `meeting-announcements`
4. Begin hourly checks for meeting reminders

### Deploying to Render

1. **Create New Web Service** on Render
2. **Connect GitHub Repository**
3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - `BOT_TOKEN`
   - `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
4. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `python bot.py`
5. **Deploy**

### Discord Commands

#### `!meeting <day>`

Fetches and posts the latest Gemini meeting summary to `meeting-summary` channel.

**Examples:**
```
!meeting tuesday
!meeting friday
!meeting today
```

**Output:**
- Single message if summary ‚â§ 1900 characters
- Multi-part messages (1800-char chunks) for longer summaries
- Includes character count and part numbers

## üìä Features Breakdown

### 1. Multi-Stage Meeting Reminders

The bot sends 4 different announcements per meeting:

| Stage | Timing | Example (Tuesday Meeting) |
|-------|--------|--------------------------|
| **Preview** | 2+ days before | "üìÖ Upcoming Meeting: Monday March 10 at 1:30 PM MT" |
| **Day Before** | Evening before (9 PM PHT) | "‚è∞ Tomorrow's Meeting: Tuesday, March 11 at 1:30 PM MT" |
| **Morning Of** | 30 min before (3:00 AM PHT) | "üö® Today's Meeting: Tuesday, March 11 at 1:30 PM MT (30 min reminder)" |
| **During Meeting** | Active time (3:30 AM PHT) | "üö® Meeting Now: Monday March 10 from 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM MT!" |

### 2. Smart Summary Retrieval

**Search Logic:**
1. Queries Google Drive for "Notes by Gemini" documents
2. Filters by modification time (last 24 hours)
3. Selects the most recently modified document
4. Exports as plain text
5. Strips BOM characters for clean formatting
6. Splits into Discord-compatible chunks if needed

**Debug Logging:**
- Lists ALL "Notes by Gemini" files (no time limit)
- Shows time-filtered results
- Displays file owners and modification times
- Logs selected document details

### 3. Persistent State Management

The bot saves announcement history to `announcement_state.json`:

```json
{
  "Tuesday_2025-03-11_preview": "2025-03-09T10:30:00",
  "Friday_2025-03-14_day_before": "2025-03-13T20:00:00"
}
```

This prevents duplicate announcements if the bot restarts.

## üîí Security Best Practices

- ‚úÖ **Never commit** `.env` files or credentials to Git
- ‚úÖ Store `BOT_TOKEN` and credentials as environment variables
- ‚úÖ Use **service accounts** (not personal Google accounts)
- ‚úÖ Limit Drive API access to specific folders only
- ‚úÖ Regularly rotate bot tokens and API keys
- ‚úÖ Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files:

```gitignore
.env
announcement_state.json
*.json
__pycache__/
*.pyc
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Bot not connecting** | Check `BOT_TOKEN` is correct and bot has proper intents |
| **Channel not found** | Ensure channels `meeting-announcements` and `meeting-summary` exist |
| **No Gemini summaries found** | Verify service account has Drive access and file name matches |
| **Duplicate announcements** | Delete `announcement_state.json` to reset state |
| **Message split errors** | Check for special characters causing Discord API issues |
| **HTTP server not responding** | Ensure port 10000 is accessible (Render requirement) |

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)  # Change from INFO to DEBUG
```

### Manual Testing

Test meeting announcements manually:

```python
# In Python shell
await send_meeting_announcement(1, datetime.now(), "preview")
```

## üìà Performance Optimization

- **Hourly task loop** checks for meeting times (lightweight)
- **Persistent state** prevents redundant API calls
- **2-second delays** between multi-part messages (rate limit protection)
- **Efficient Drive queries** use time filtering to reduce results
- **Single HTTP server thread** minimizes resource usage
